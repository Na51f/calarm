# Calarm
This is a calendar and alarm combo. Set alarms as calendar events and vice versa.

## Why?
Imagine you have a seminar for 'The Super Duper Tech Bros Night' and you were invited to this event through a Google Calendar invite email. You accept the invitation email and poof it's on your calendar, like it normally would on virtually any calendar. Usually you can set the event to send you a notification before the event but what if you don't hear the notification? You totally forgot and missed the seminar! 
This is why Calarm exists. One thing mostly missing from any calendar app is the option to turn an event into an alarm so that you are alerted until you dismiss the notification and on the other hand, have all your alarms show up on your calendar. 

## TODO
- [ ] Add and remove items on alarm.
- [ ] Make Alarm times show up on calendar. (For the next two weeks or however long the user sets)
- [ ] Add and remove events to the calendar.
- [ ] Add Google account login
